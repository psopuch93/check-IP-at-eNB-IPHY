# check-IP-at-eNB-IPHY

<h1>For what?</h1>

  Bash script that helps me automate my job. I'm working with some devices with specify IP, manual pinging is boring so I wrote this script.

<h1>How to use</h1>

  Just copy script in your Linux machine and type:

``` bash modules.sh ```

  Add some alias:
  
``` vim ~/.bashrc ```

```  alias modules=‚Äùbash modules.sh"  ```

  Save the file. The file will be automatically loaded in your next session. If you want to use the newly defined alias in the current session, issue the following   command:

``` source ~/.bashrc ```
  
  Type in terminal:
  
  ``` modules```
